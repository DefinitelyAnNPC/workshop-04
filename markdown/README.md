# Workshop-04

By: John Bushie

## Emphasis

Trent colleges are small *local communities* that promote learning, embrace diversity, and can lead to friendships that last a lifetime. Your college will serve as your “home away from home”; a place where you can connect with other students, faculty and staff in a fun and informal setting. Everyone is a part of a college at our _Peterborough campus_, regardless of whether you commute or live in residence. When course registration opens, choose a college based on what speaks to your interests, and feel free to switch affiliation if you make a connection in a different college.

## Strong

One of the most exciting parts of planning your **postsecondary education** is figuring out what classes you are going to take first!

Within 2-months prior to classes starting, you’ll be able to log into your MyTrent portal and register for courses under the Academics tab. We’ve also got plenty of __helpful information__ and video tutorials online at trentu.ca/advising/online-resources/course-selection-and-registration to get you started on course selection, creating your timetable and more. Building your schedule takes time, but don’t worry—it’s easier than you think!
